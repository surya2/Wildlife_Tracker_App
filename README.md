# Django Webapplication
## Webapplication that allows users to submit pictures of spotted wildlife and provide coordinates of where the wildlife was discovered.

Aim of project: Allow outdoor enthusiasts to stay connected with each other, whether it is in a college campus or neighborhood, and share locations of interest to them.
Personal Story: I started this project because my neighborhood has several forest areas nearby. However, I had no idea how to access wildlife in the forests until one day I found people trekking a trail inthe forests behind my house. If I did not live at the specific location where I live today, I would not have know of the existence of trails in my neighborhood and so wouldn't many other people in the community. Thus, this app allows users to pinpoint the location of trails, wildlife features, and even spotted animals.
